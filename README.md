# Blog Web
***
The **blog-web** website is designed to display a list of post. You can add new post, edit them or delete them.
This program does not use a database so it cannot save created posts.

## Technologies used
Built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS and with the help of some Javascript

## How to clone and build it
To get the site up and running on your local machine, follow these steps: 
1. Clone the repository:  
    `git clone https://github.com/BaoBG/blogWebApp.git`

2. Add all the express modules required (they are listed in the package.json file) by building the project with:  
	`npm i`  

3. Start the server (you can use node or nodemon):  
	`node index.js`  
	or  
	`nodemon index.js`
4. Open your browser:  
	`Navigate to 'http://localhost:3000' to view the app.`
